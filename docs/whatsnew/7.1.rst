.. _whatsnew-7.1-table-spaces:

Trailing whitespace in ``Table`` string columns can now be stripped
===================================================================

Strings in FITS binary tables are sometimes padded with trailing whitespace.
It is now possible to remove those when reading a table with
``(Q)Table.read("filename.fits", strip_spaces=True)``. The default behavior is
not changed yet to preserve compatibility with codes that might rely on this,
it will change in the next major version (v8.0).

.. _whatsnew_7_1_dataorigin:

New ``dataorigin`` module
=========================

This new module exploits provenance information from VOTable header. The information is described in
DataOrigin IVOA note: https://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataOrigin/.

DataOrigin includes both the query information (such as publisher, contact, versions, etc.)
and the Dataset origin (such as Creator, bibliographic links, URL, etc.)

This API retrieves Metadata from INFO in VOTAble.
